# Mood_Detector
This project utilizes the DeepFace library to detect emotions from a live video feed using a webcam. The detected emotions are logged to a CSV file for tracking mood swings over time. Additionally, the detected face is highlighted with a rectangle, and the emotion is displayed on the screen.
